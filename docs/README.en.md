## Harness Specifications

`docs/sage_harness/` is the source of truth for installed hook, agent, skill, and MCP specs plus the
manifest. These files are consumed by the engine and generator. Structural changes must be followed
by `sage generate` and `sage validate`.

## Agent Framework

The engine sources these protocols from `templates/core/framework/docs/agent/`. `sage install`
deploys them to `docs/agent/` in the target repository. Put project policy in
`sage/project-profile.yaml` and project-owned governance documents instead of editing installed
framework renders.
