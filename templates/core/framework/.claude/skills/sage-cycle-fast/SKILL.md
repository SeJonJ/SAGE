# sage-cycle-fast

Invoke as `/sage-cycle-fast` on Claude or `$sage-cycle-fast` on Codex.

This is a **CORE framework bootstrap asset**, hand-shipped by `sage install` and
not manifest-tracked. Do not edit an installed copy directly.

Fast Cycle is an explicitly enabled L2/L3 alternate protocol, not an override.
It keeps actual risk, deterministic verification, acceptance, independent
approval, 05/06, and audit evidence while consolidating physical 01 through 04
documents into one composite 00 Fast Plan.

## Conversation language (mandatory)

Resolve it once, before the first turn, in this order:

1. an explicit `--lang ko|en` on this skill's invocation,
2. `interface.language` in `sage/project-profile.local.yaml`,
3. `ko`.

Conduct **every** question, proposal, progress note, warning and summary in that language.

Only the conversation takes it. Machine values are never translated — paths, globs, command
strings, component ids, strategy enums, statuses and the fixed schema keys. Phase 00–06 document
prose follows the cycle's `Document-Language:` marker, which is a **separate** decision and may
differ from the conversation. That document prose includes the **human-facing structure** — section
headings, list labels, table headers and checklist text — not just paragraphs; a Korean document
under English headings is the mixed state the marker exists to prevent. The two headings a parser
reads by their exact string, `## 5. Done Criteria` and `## 6. Done Criteria Revision Log`, stay
English in every language. Only `/sage-init` and `/sage-init-local` may persist a language
preference. Full rules: `docs/agent/language-policy.md`.

## Procedure

1. Read the shared profile and stop unless `pdca.fast_cycle.enabled: true`.
2. Resolve the current Cycle-Stem and inspect its exact 00 document and Fast audit.
3. If no composite Fast Plan and active Fast run exist, delegate to
   `sage-plan-fast`. Do not duplicate its interview or planning steps here.
   A Fast run has two entry modes and `sage-plan-fast` owns both: a fresh open from a
   composite Phase 00, and — for a cycle already past Phase 00, only when
   `pdca.fast_cycle.standard_transition.enabled` is true — an explicitly confirmed
   `sage fast-cycle convert`. Read the entry mode before judging a document:
   `sage fast-cycle show --run-id <fc-id>` prints `entry=FAST` or `entry=FAST-CONVERTED`.
   **Only on `entry=FAST-CONVERTED`** is a missing `Fast-Audit-Run` line normal — that run
   binds by stem instead. On `entry=FAST` the same missing or `pending` line is a defect to
   fix, so never treat it as normal without checking which mode you are in.
4. After planning/open succeeds, delegate to `sage-team-fast`. Do not duplicate
   its implementation, review, close, or clear steps here.
5. Report the actual risk, Fast review level, selected lenses, reason, Fast run,
   Loop run, and final result.

This umbrella does not execute cycle declaration or audit commands itself. The
two delegated skills own those state transitions so there is one writer per step.
